# 🐻 Bear Login Animation – Flutter App  
Interactive login screen using Rive animations

---

## ✨ Short Description of Functionalities
This project implements a fun and interactive login screen using Flutter and Rive.  
The bear reacts to user actions in real time:

- 👀 Eyes covered when typing the password
- 😳 Bear looks surprised when the password is shown
- ✅ Success animation when credentials are valid
- ❌ Error animation when login fails

This improves user experience through smooth and playful UI feedback.

## 🎨 What is Rive?  
**Rive** is an animation tool that allows developers and designers to create real-time, interactive animations that can be used in applications, games, and websites.

### 🧠 What is a State Machine in Rive?
A **State Machine** in Rive controls how animations change based on user interactions or app logic.  
Example in this project:
- Input → User types password  
- Trigger → Animation changes to “Bear covers eyes”

It allows animations to react dynamically to the UI.
